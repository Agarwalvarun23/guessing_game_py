# Word Guessing Game â€“ Python Project

This is a simple word guessing game built using Python. The game has a predefined secret word, and the user gets a limited number of attempts to guess it correctly. The program uses a `while` loop to manage user input and game logic.

## Features

- Predefined secret word
- Maximum of 3 guess attempts
- User-friendly prompts and responses
- Clean use of `while` loop and basic control flow

## How It Works

- The program sets a secret word internally.
- The user is prompted to guess the word.
- The user is allowed a maximum of 3 attempts.
- If the user guesses the word correctly within the allowed attempts, a success message is shown.
- If the user fails to guess correctly within 3 tries, the game ends with a failure message.

## Getting Started

1. Copy the Python script into a `.py` file.
2. Run the program using:
